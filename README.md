**SO4GP** is a high-performance Python library designed to optimize the extraction of gradual patterns from large-scale 
datasets. By integrating advanced computation techniques and data management strategies, the library significantly 
reduces processing time and memory overhead during knowledge discovery. 

## Implemented Extraction Algorithms
The library provides native Python implementations for the core and meta-heuristic gradual pattern mining algorithms. Here are some examples:

* **GRAANK**: The foundational classical approach for mining gradual patterns.
* **Ant Colony Optimization (AntGRAANK)**: Meta-heuristic ACO algorithm for search-space pruning GP candidates.
* **Genetic Algorithm (GeneticGRAANK)**: Meta-heuristic GA for search-space pruning GP candidates.
* **Particle Swarm Optimization (ParticleGRAANK)**: Meta-heuristic PSO algorithm for search-space pruning GP candidates.
* **Random Search (HillClimbingGRAANK)**: Baseline stochastic search variant for pruning GP candidates.
* **Clustering-based Mining (ClusterGP)**: Applies K-Means clustering approximation to mine GPs.
* **TGRAANK**: extends GRAANK to mine GPs with temporal lags.

### What are Gradual Patterns?
A **Gradual Pattern (GP)** is a co-occurring set of **gradual items (GI)** that captures covariations between attributes. 
A pattern's quality is measured quantitatively by its computed **support value**.

#### Example
Consider a dataset containing 10 objects with 3 attributes: `age`, `salary`, and `cars`. An extracted GP might look like:

$$\{\text{age}^+, \text{salary}^-\} \quad [\text{Support} = 0.8]$$

This output explicitly reveals that in **80% of the dataset** (8 out of 10 objects), an increase in `age` ($^+$) strongly 
correlates with a simultaneous decrease in `salary` ($^-$).


## Installation

```shell
pip install so4gp
```

## Usage
To use any algorithm to mine GPs, follow the instructions that follow.

First and foremost, import the **so4gp** python package via:

```python
import so4gp as sgp
# OR 
from so4gp.algorithms import GRAANK, TGRAANK, ClusterGP
```

### GRAdual rANKing Algorithm for GPs (GRAANK)

This is the classical approach (initially proposed by Anne Laurent) for mining gradual patterns. All the remaining algorithms 
are variants of this algorithm.

```python
import pandas as pd
from so4gp.algorithms import GRAANK

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [30, 3, 1, 10],
        [35, 2, 2, 8],
        [40, 4, 2, 7],
        [50, 1, 1, 6],
        [52, 7, 1, 2],
    ],
    columns=["Age", "Salary", "Cars", "Expenses"],
)

miner_gp = GRAANK(
    data_source=df,
    min_sup=0.5,
)

results = miner_gp.discover()

print(results)

```

where you specify the parameters as follows:

* **data_source** - *[required]* data source {either a ```file in csv format``` or a ```Pandas DataFrame```}
* **min_sup** - *[optional]* minimum support ```default = 0.5```
* **eq** - *[optional]* encode equal values as gradual ```default = False```


### Sample Output
The default output is the format of JSON:

```json
{
	"Algorithm": "GRAANK",
	"Patterns": [
            [["Age+", "Salary+"], 0.6], 
            [["Expenses-", "Age+", "Salary+"], 0.6]
	]
}
```
