**SO4GP** stands for: "Swarm Optimization for Gradual Patterns". SO4GP applies swarm intelligence to extraction of gradual patterns. It provides Python algorithm implementations of swarm-based optimization algorithms for mining gradual patterns. The algorithm implementations include:

* Ant Colony Optimization
<!--- * Genetic Algorithm
* Particle Swarm Optimization
* Wasp Swarm Optimization
* Pure Random Search
* Pure Local Search --->
