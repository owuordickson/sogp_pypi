# Introduction


**SO4GP** stands for: "Some Optimizations for Gradual Patterns". SO4GP applies optimizations such as swarm intelligence, HDF5 chunks, cluster analysis, and many others to improve the efficiency of extracting gradual patterns.

| Age | Salary | Cars |
|-----|------|--------|
| 23  | 52000 | 0 |
| 27  | 51000 | 1 |
| 31  | 50000 | 1 |
| 36  | 48000 | 1 |
| 40  | 47000 | 2 |
| 40  | 45000 | 2 |

A GP (Gradual Pattern) is a set of gradual items (GI), and its quality is measured by its computed support value. For example, given a data set with 3 features (age, salary, cars) and 6 objects. A GP may take the form: {age+, salary-} with a support of 0.83. This implies that 5 out of 6 objects have the values of **age** *'increasing'* and **salary** *'decreasing'*.


## Installation
The library is available on **PyPI**. To install it, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install so4gp
```

## Basic Usage
After installing the ```so4gp``` package, you can import it as follows:

```{code-block} python
import so4gp as sgp
```

The ```sgp``` namespace contains all necessary classes, functions, and algorithms. Classes and functions are accessible via ```sgp.ClassName``` or ```sgp.function_name```, while algorithms are located under ```sgp.algorithms.AlgorithmName```.

The ```so4gp``` algorithms require a numeric dataset provided as either a ```pandas.DataFrame``` or a path to a ```CSV``` file.

All ```so4gp``` functions and classes are documented in the **API Section**.
