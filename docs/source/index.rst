Welcome to so4gp's documentation!
=================================


**SO4GP** stands for: "Some Optimizations for Gradual Patterns". SO4GP applies optimizations such as swarm intelligence, HDF5 chunks, SVD and many others in order to improve the efficiency of extracting gradual patterns. It provides Python algorithm implementations for these optimization techniques. The algorithm implementations include:

* Ant Colony Optimization
* Genetic Algorithm
* Particle Swarm Optimization
* Random Search
* Local Search
