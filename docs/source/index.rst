=================================


**SO4GP** stands for: "Some Optimizations for Gradual Patterns". SO4GP applies optimizations such as swarm intelligence, HDF5 chunks, SVD and many others in order to improve the efficiency of extracting gradual patterns. It provides Python algorithm implementations for these optimization techniques. The algorithm implementations include:

* (Classical) GRAANK algorithm for extracting GPs
* Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs
* Genetic Algorithm for extracting GPs
* Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for extracting GPs
* Random Search algorithm for extracting GPs
* Local Search algorithm for extracting GPs
