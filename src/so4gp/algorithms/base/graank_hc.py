        Extract gradual patterns (GPs) from a numeric data source using the Hill Climbing (Local Search) Algorithm
        approach (proposed in a published research paper by Dickson Owuor). A GP is a set of gradual items (GI), and its
        quality is measured by its computed support value. For example, given a data set with 3 columns (age, salary,
        cars) and 10 objects. A GP may take the form: {age+, salary-} with a support of 0.8. This implies that 8 out of
        10 objects have the values of column age 'increasing' and column 'salary' decreasing.

        In this approach, we assume that every GP candidate may be represented as a position that has cost value
        associated with it. The cost is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support
        value, the lower the cost. The aim of the algorithm is to search through a group of positions and find those with
        the lowest cost as efficiently as possible.
