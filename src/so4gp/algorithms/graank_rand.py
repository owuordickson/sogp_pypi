    Extract gradual patterns (GPs) from a numeric data source using the Random Search Algorithm (LS-GRAANK)
    approach (proposed in a published research paper by Dickson Owuor). A GP is a set of gradual items (GI) and its
    quality is measured by its computed support value. For example given a data set with 3 columns (age, salary,
    cars) and 10 objects. A GP may take the form: {age+, salary-} with a support of 0.8. This implies that 8 out of
    10 objects have the values of column age 'increasing' and column 'salary' decreasing.

         In this approach, it is assumed that every GP candidate may be represented as a position that has a cost value
         associated with it. The cost is derived from the computed support of that candidate, the higher the support
         value the lower the cost. The aim of the algorithm is search through group of positions and find those with
         the lowest cost as efficiently as possible.

    This class extends class DataGP, and it provides the following additional attributes:
